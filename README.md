# Competitive Coding Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various **competitive programming problems** from multiple platforms and contests.  
The goal of this repository is to document my learning process, practice problem-solving, and provide reference implementations for others.

---

## Sources

Problems come from:
- **USACO Training Gateway**
- **IOI** and **ICPC** past papers
- **Codeforces** contests
- **CSES Problem Set**
- Other online contests and archives
---

## Repository Structure

- File names are chosen to match the problem they solve.
- For **IOI** and **ICPC** problems, the corresponding past paper is included in the solution folder.
- For **Codeforces** problems, a link to the original problem is provided in the solution file.
- For other sources (e.g., USACO, CSES), the problems can be found on their respective websites, and the names of the solution files indicate which problem they solve so an interested user can find the corresponding problem.

| Source      | Description                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| USACO       | Training gateway problems, classic algorithmic exercises.          |
| IOI / ICPC  | Past paper problems with included PDFs for reference.              |
| Codeforces  | Contest problems, with links in the solution files.                |
| CSES        | Problem set solutions covering a wide range of algorithms.         |
| Misc.       | Other competitive programming problems and online contests.        |

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Competitive_Coding_Solutions.git
2. Navigate to the folder of interest and open the solution file.
3. Compile and run it in your preferred environment. All of my solutions are written in either *C* or *C++*.
